# Project Title
Fuzzy Logic-Based Health Monitoring System

## Project Description
This project implements a fuzzy logic system to analyze health parameters, specifically blood pressure (BP) and temperature. Traditional classification of BP (Low, Normal, High) is extended using fuzzy logic for more nuanced health assessments. The system takes inputs of BP and temperature to determine health conditions (Good, Normal, Worst) based on fuzzy rules defined by domain experts. The implementation includes defining fuzzy sets, creating rules, and computing defuzzified outputs to provide pragmatic health condition assessments.

## What I Learned
- **Fuzzy Logic Application:** Developed proficiency in applying fuzzy logic algorithms for health parameter analysis, enhancing accuracy over traditional linear models.
- **System Implementation:** Gained experience in implementing fuzzy logic systems using Python and the scikit-fuzzy library.
- **Rule-Based Systems:** Designed and optimized fuzzy rules to infer health conditions from BP and temperature inputs.
- **Defuzzification Techniques:** Implemented defuzzification methods to derive crisp values from fuzzy outputs for practical use.
- **Collaborative Project Development:** Demonstrated teamwork skills through collaboration with peers in system design, rule formulation, and result evaluation.
